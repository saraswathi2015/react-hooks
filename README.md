# React Hooks Project

This is a React project demonstrating the use of various React Hooks and Higher-Order Components (HOCs). The project showcases hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useCallback`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, as well as custom hooks and HOCs for handling state management, side effects, and performance optimizations.

## Features

- **useState**: Manage component state.
- **useEffect**: Handle side effects like API calls, event listeners, etc.
- **useContext**: Share global state across components without prop drilling.
- **useReducer**: Alternative to `useState` for complex state logic.
- **useCallback**: Memoize functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **useRef**: Access and interact with DOM elements and store mutable values.
- **useMemo**: Optimize performance by memoizing expensive calculations.
- **Custom Hooks**: Create reusable logic to manage state and side effects.
- **Higher-Order Components (HOC)**: Enhance the functionality of components by adding additional props and logic.
